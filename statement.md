Problem Statement : Managing student course registration manually can be time-consuming and error-prone. Colleges often face issues such as missing student details, wrong course mappings, and difficulty in maintaining a proper record.
There is a need for a simple digital system where students can be added, courses can be viewed, and registrations can be stored safely in a database. This project solves that problem by creating a small console-based Java application that connects to a MySQL database using JDBC.

Scope of the Project : The scope of this project includes: A menu-based system that can run in any computer terminal , Adding new student information (name and email) , Viewing the list of available courses stored in the database , Registering a student for any available course , Storing all records permanently inside a MySQL database , Demonstrating Java OOP, exception handling, and JDBC connectivity , Limited to basic CRUD-style operations (no GUI or website) , This system is designed to focus only on the core functional flow of a student registration process at a small level.

Target Users : This system is mainly intended for: Students, who need to register for courses , College staff or administrators, who manage student and course data , Beginners learning Java, who want to understand JDBC and OOP , Academic projects, where simple database-connected applications are required.

High-Level Features : Add Student
Allows entering and saving new student details in the database.

View Courses
Shows all available courses already stored in the database.

Register Student for a Course
Links a student ID with a course ID and stores it in the registrations table.

Database Connectivity
Uses JDBC to connect Java with MySQL and store/retrieve data.

Menu-Based Interface
User navigates through options easily using numbers.

Error & Exception Handling
Handles invalid input, connection errors, and SQL issues safely.
